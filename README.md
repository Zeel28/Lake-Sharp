# Lake-Sharp
[![](data/Lake%20Sharp%20logo.png)](https://bit.ly/3TML0W2)
I developed my own programming language, called Lake-Sharp ( Lake# ), using Python.

This code is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language written in Python 3.
I'm now finished with the development of this project, and the tutorials are complete on YouTube.

## Comment
* comments begin with the “#” character. Anything that is written in a single line after ‘#’ is considered as a comment. The syntax for writing single-line comments is:
```bash
# comments here
# this codelake comment
```
